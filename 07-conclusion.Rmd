# Conclusion

Thus, there was a race bias between black people and white people in COMPAS score. More specifically, black defendants are more likely to be regarded as more dangerous than white defendants. Through this research, we suggest that before using the designed algorithm to evaluate the possibility of the criminal defendant's reoffending, please determine the fairness and feasibility of the algorithm. This guarantees the long-term security of the society and the rights and interests of defendants.More validity testing is required in predictive policing algorithm.
