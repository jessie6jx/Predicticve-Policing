Across the country, judges, probation and parole officials are paying more and more attention to and using big data and algorithms to assess the possibility of criminal defendants recidivism, because criminals’ recidivism may cause more harm to society than before.We found an analysis algorithm called COMPAS on the Internet, and want to further study the rationality of the algorithm. And we will use the NYPD 2020 crime dataset to further illustrate the Problematic nature of predictive policing in terms of the bias towards minorities and problematic composition of the data (e.g.: false positives/false negatives, erroneous focus, etc). Different visualization tools will be used in this project.

The amount of black prepetrators is greater than white hispanic, white and black hispanic prepetrtors combined. ##Plot2:SEX Much more perpetrators are male.Male perpetrator population is five times as large as female perpetrators population. ##Plot3:AGE GROUP Most perpetrators aged between 25-44. ##Plot4:BORO Brooklyn is the most dangerous borough with most crime cases in 2020. ##Plot5:Offense Type (Top 10) Multi-variable analysis (Mosaic Plot/Density Plot) ##PLOT 1: age+sex (Mosaic Plot) ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## # Groups: age [5] ## age sex count ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 &lt;18 F 938 ## 2 &lt;18 M 4907 ## 3 18-24 F 5087 ## 4 18-24 M 23300 ## 5 25-44 F 13279 ## 6 25-44 M 64092 ## 7 45-64 F 3917 ## 8 45-64 M 23107 ## 9 65+ F 253 ## 10 65+ M 1496 ##PLOT 2: sex+age+boro (facet histogram/interactive version in chapter 06) ##PLOT 3: boro+race (Density Plot) ##PLOT 4: boro+race(Tree Map) Following from the EDA above, we can clearly see crime case number differs in different borough/sex/race/age: Brooklyn and Manhattan had the most crimes. Black is the racial group with highest crime cases yet in Staten island,high risk group is white, and in Queens, the high risk group is Asian. No matter in which borogh, the highest risk age group is always 25-44. As for predictive policing, people will tag certain racial group/borough/age group/sex as High risk based on the statistics result shown above. But is this reasonable? We will further discuss the bias in predictive policing later. Now let’s take a deeper look at the crimes by precinct by using spatial analysis tool.

To ensure that the sample size is large enough for research, we select these top two races for future research. #The COMPAS model gives each defendant a decile score to rank the possibility of them committing a crime again and classifies people into High(8-10), Medium(5-7) and Low risk(1-4) corresponding to decile score. We first explore how the decile scores are distributed in African-American and Caucaian. #From the density plot, we can tell there is a clear downward trend in the decile scores as those scores increase for white defendants. However, the score for black people is more like a uniform distribution. We can’t help questioning whether there is a significant difference in recidivism scores between races. We decided to use logistic regression to get a quantitative look on it. ## Length Class Mode ## 6172 character character ## Length Class Mode ## 6172 character character ## Length Class Mode ## 6172 character character Part2 Whether there is a Significant Difference in COMPAS Scores Between Races ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = score_factor ~ gender_factor + age_factor + race_factor, ## family = &quot;binomial&quot;, data = df) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.6740 -0.9517 -0.6254 1.0519 2.2114 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This outcome supports our suspicion about race bias on CAMPOS score. From the mosaic plot above, we also can see that black people are more likely to have a higher score. However, the other said that black defendants have a higher risk score because that they scored higher input factors, such as drug problems, correlated to race. In order to verify their claims, we further studied the relationship between drug crimes and races.

More specifically, black defendants are more likely to be regarded as more dangerous than white defendants. Through this research, we suggest that before using the designed algorithm to evaluate the possibility of the criminal defendant’s reoffending, please determine the fairness and feasibility of the algorithm. This guarantees the long-term security of the society and the rights and interests of defendants.More validity testing is required in predictive policing algorithm. "]]
