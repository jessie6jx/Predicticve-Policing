# Introduction
Welcome to the "Age of Big Data",a time with abundant data and data-driven decisions. Across the country, judges, probation and parole officials are paying more and more attention to and using big data and algorithms to assess the possibility of criminal defendants recidivism, because criminalsâ€™ recidivism may cause more harm to society than before.We found an analysis algorithm called COMPAS on the Internet, and want to further study the rationality of the algorithm. And we will use the NYPD 2020 crime dataset to further illustrate the Problematic nature of predictive policing in terms of the bias towards minorities and problematic composition of the data (e.g.: false positives/false negatives, erroneous focus, etc). Different visualization tools will be used in this project.
